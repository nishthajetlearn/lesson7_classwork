Theoritical Session

The main aim of the session is to get the kid prepared for the comming lessons on data-analysis and machine learning.
The kid needs to understand the concept well. Try to avoid the mathematical explanation as far as possible.

The concepts to be discussed are as follows - 
1) What is Machine Learning ?
2) Applications of Machine Learning in real world
3) Types of Machine Learning - 
    a) Supervised Learning
    b) Unsupervised Learning
    c) Reinforcement Learning
    # Explain the concept of each type of machine leanring with real life scenarios / examples

4) Types of Machine Learning Problems - 
    a) Regeression
    b) Classification
    c) Recommendation
    # Explain the concept of each problem type with real life scenarios / examples

5) Steps to be followed in a Machine Leanring Project - 
    a) Gathering the data and load the data into the program
    b) Data Preprocessing - prepare the data for further machine learning projects
    c) Data Analysis - Analyse the data so that you can define your input and output columns and drop the rest
    d) Define Input and Output - Create separate dataframes for input - output 
    e) Perform the test-train split - Split up the data into testing and training data , Explain the use of training and testing data
    f) Select the machine learning algorithm perform the training of the model.
    g) Perform predictions and compare the predictions with actual result to calculate accuracy.

    # Breifly explain the use and concept behind the steps, explain terms such as accuracy, predictions etc which are used in above steps
